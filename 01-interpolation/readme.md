## Interpolation

Interpolation, simply means that inside Vue declared scope,you can reference properties, that are part of that object, you return in data,and then the value of the property will be output instead of this part.

Syntax of Interpolation is ***{{ valueName }}***

And Vue automatically detect this and do all that outputting part for you. If you use this syntax. And just to make this really clear,
if you would use this anywhere else, let's say here in the header,
which is not Vue controlled, you would just see this as text
and it would not be replaced because that is really only a Vue feature.This interpolation syntax.And this interpolation syntax is key.

# Understanding "methods"

let's say we actually have two possible courseGoals,
which we wanna output here. And for the moment, we'll randomly decide
which one to output. Now for that, we need to run some code.
We need to basically roll a dice you could say, and then either use this text or another text as a courseGoal. And we can do this with another option. We can set on this Vue app object. We already set the data option.Now it's time to learn about a new option.

And that's the methods option. Methods allows you to define functions which should execute when something happens when you call them for example, or as you will learn later, when a user event like a button click occurs.

Two methods you pass a JavaScript object. So that's important difference to data.Data itself was a function a method, methods takes an object, which will be full of methods, so of functions, but these functions are now totally up to you. You can name them however you want.
